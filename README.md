# FastAPI Wikipedia Search Comparison ðŸ§ âš¡

This is a simple FastAPI project that demonstrates how a **small change in an API parameter** can drastically improve the accuracy of search results â€” using Wikipedia as the example.

### ðŸ§ª Why this app?

While exploring the Wikipedia Python API, I noticed odd behavior:
- Searching for `"pizza"` gave me a result about **town squares**
- Searching for `"piazza"` gave me a result about **Italian food**

Thatâ€™s when I learned that Wikipediaâ€™s API uses **auto-suggest and fuzzy matching**, which can lead to surprising bugs.

### ðŸ’¡ What this app shows

This app includes **two search versions**, side by side:

- ðŸ”¹ **Version A â€“ Basic**  
  Uses `wikipedia.summary(query)` â€” the default behavior (fast, but error-prone)

- ðŸ”¸ **Version B â€“ Improved**  
  Uses `wikipedia.page(query, auto_suggest=False)`  
  Adds a fallback to `wikipedia.search()` for better accuracy

You can run both and compare how a single parameter (`auto_suggest`) improves reliability.
